# ChompPyGame

Chomp! involves assigning the player one of three randomly generated animals (elephant, monkey or toucan). Each animal can only eat a certain type of fruit (apple, banana or orange) and the objective is to eat all of the correct fruit on the screen as fast as possible. Eating a wrong fruit results in instant loss. In order to create this game, PyGame capabilities were used in conjunction with the 3-step process of processing user inputs, updating the game, and drawing/rendering on-screen. Several states were created and would be invoked depending on the stage of the present game -- for example: if the player is a toucan and eats a banana (incorrect), the loss state is entered. To detect when the player ate a fruit, PyGame’s colliderect function was used with specific selection statements to check if a fruit was eaten AND whether it was the correct fruit. Scoring was based on the assumption that a maximum of 3 minutes would be taken to play the game, and 180 - half of the total time that had lapsed by the end of a winning game would be the player’s final score.
